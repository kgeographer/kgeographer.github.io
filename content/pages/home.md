KGEO Research is my one–person consultancy for experiments at the intersection of **geography**, **digital humanities**, and **software development**, established in 2017 following about 5 years employ at Stanford University's Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIDR).

I’m Karl Grossner, PhD – a geographer and **digital humanities research developer**. My work entails both traditional academic research and software development. I have co-conceived and co-designed a number of DH projects with scholars, cultural heritage professionals, and research groups, then built the bespoke tools and platforms the projects required.

Over the past fifteen years I’ve helped design and implement projects such as:

- historical travel models and narrative maps of the Roman world  
- visual and analytical tools for urban nature and environmental justice  
- living archives for archaeological fieldwork  
- linked open data gazetteers and formats for historical place data  
- experimental interfaces for exploring myths, and folklore motifs geographically  

These projects are described in more detail in the **Portfolio**, with links to running sites and code where possible.

### What I do

KGEO Research focuses on:

- **Concept and data modeling** for humanities and social-science projects  
- **Geographic information workflows** (spatial databases, gazetteers, historical place data)  
- **Prototype web applications** in Python/Django and related stacks  
- **Narrative and text-analysis pipelines**, experimental use and evaluation of AI technologies and methods (LLMs, embeddings)
- **Consulting on DH infrastructure**, especially where place, time, and story intersect  

The common thread is collaboration: I have worked closely with domain experts and project teams to shape the questions, the data models, tools, and interfaces required by research projects. Software follows from that co-design process.

### How this site is organized

- **Portfolio** – selected projects and infrastructures I’ve co-designed and built  
- **Blog** – occasional posts about ongoing work, methods, and reflections  
- **Personal** – more informal notes, photos, and art  
- **CV** – full academic and professional background

If you’re interested in working together on a project, the Portfolio and CV are good places to start.
