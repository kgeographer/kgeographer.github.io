KGEO Research is my one–person consultancy for work at the intersection of **geography**, **digital humanities**, and **software development**, established in 2017 following five years at Stanford University's Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIDR).

I’m Karl Grossner, PhD – a geographer and **digital humanities research developer**. My work entails both traditional academic research and software development. I have co-conceived and co-designed a number of DH projects with scholars, cultural heritage professionals, and research groups, then built bespoke tools and/or digital platforms, as required. 

Over the past fifteen years I’ve helped design and implement projects involving:

- Route modeling and mapped simulation of historical movement (ORBIS)
- Linked gazetteers and open spatial infrastructures (World Historical Gazetteer)
- Literary-geographical analysis and text-to-map workflows (Authorial London)
- Living archives for multimodal archaeological data environments (Catalhöyük)
- Urban environmental analysis and interactive visualizations (CityNature)
- Computational tools for exploring folklore motifs and myth structure (Geographic Lens on Stories)

These projects are described in more detail in the <a href="/portfolio">**Portfolio**</a>, with links to running sites and code where possible.

### What I do

KGEO Research focuses on:

- **Concept and data modeling** for humanities and social science projects  
- **Geographic information workflows** involving spatial-temporal databases, historical place data, and thematic content
- **Building web applications** using Python/Django and related software stacks, from pilots to finished platforms
- **Narrative and text-analysis pipelines**, experimental use and evaluation of AI technologies and methods (LLMs, embeddings)
- **Consulting on DH research design**, especially where place, time, and story intersect  

The common thread is collaboration: I have worked closely with domain experts and project teams to shape the questions, the data models, tools, and interfaces required by research projects. Software follows from that co-design process.

### How this site is organized

- **Portfolio** – selected projects and infrastructures I’ve co-designed and built  
- **Blog** – occasional posts about ongoing work, methods, and reflections  
- **Personal** – more informal notes, photos, and art  
- **CV** – full academic and professional background
