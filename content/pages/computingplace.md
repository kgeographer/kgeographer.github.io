Summary: Environmental profiling infrastructure for historical gazetteers

**Computing Place** is a research infrastructure for environmental and cultural profiling of historical places. The core idea: every place on Earth has an environmental signature—shaped by its position within drainage basins, elevation zones, climate patterns, and ecoregions. By computing these signatures systematically, we can enable new forms of spatial analysis for gazetteers, historical databases, and digital humanities projects.

The platform is being developed modularly. **EDOP** (Environmental Dimensions of Place) is the first component, now live—it provides basin-scale environmental profiles using HydroATLAS watershed data, digital elevation models, and WWF ecoregion classifications. A future **CDOP** component (Cultural DImensions of Place) will add cultural and semantic dimensions. The full Computing Place platform will integrate these modules, offering APIs that existing gazetteers and historical research infrastructures can consume to enrich their place data as well as related interactive tools.
