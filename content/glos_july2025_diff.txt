+The GLOS Project ([Github repo](https://github.com/kgeographer/glos)) is an inquiry into the geography of stories—developing experimental computational methods to analyze the conceptual content of folklore, beginning with creation myths. At the core of this effort are two premises:
 
 1. that narrative texts encode cultural knowledge in ways that are neither purely linguistic nor purely thematic, but discoverable as conceptual structures, albeit ones that vary across traditions, locales, and genres.
-2. that the narrative themes and motifs emitting from, or descriptive of a place are dimensions of that place, potentially a window into the human experience of it
+2. that the narrative themes and motifs associated with a place are themselves dimensions of that place—offering a lens into its cultural and experiential character
 
-The project’s current focus, ([the "Phase B" referenced in an earlier post](/glos_june2025)) is on using large language models (LLMs) to help induce a schema—a structured, reusable framework—for describing and comparing the conceptual content of creation myths across cultures. This effort stands alongside more traditional folkloristic indexing systems, such as [the Aarne-Thompson-Uther (ATU) tale type index and the Thompson Motif Index (TMI)]((https://guides.library.harvard.edu/folk_and_myth)), which classify stories based on recurring plot patterns and narrative motifs. While those systems remain foundational, they were not designed with cross-cultural conceptual analysis in mind, and they are limited in the kinds of inferences they enable computationally. Phase A developed pilot tools for exploring those indexes and connections between them (see the [GLOS tools site](http://glos.kgeographer.org)).

 ### From Motif Lists to Conceptual Structures
 A schema in this context is a structured set of conceptual categories—like _primordial state_, _cosmic structure_, _creation sequence_, and _dualities and oppositions_—each of which can be represented with values drawn from narrative evidence or left null when absent. Such a schema would allow myths from very different traditions to be compared not only by plot similarity but by conceptual architecture: what roles are enacted, what principles govern creation, what kinds of boundaries are drawn between divine and mortal, chaos and order, known and unknown.

 In parallel with these modeling experiments, I’m expanding the working corpus. The first source is [Barbara Sproul’s _Primal Myths: Creation Myths Around the World_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1295530.Primal_Myths), a mid-20th century anthology that assembles over 140 creation narratives from cultures around the world. These are being digitized, cleaned, and lightly annotated to support both human and machine-readable analysis. Each myth is treated as a case study for schema testing—both a source of conceptual content and a challenge to the universality of any proposed schema.
 
 ### Evaluation and Reflexivity
-A key concern—especially in a field like folklore—is the epistemological validity of any structure generated by a model trained on vast, culturally uneven corpora. LLMs may mirror prevailing narrative tropes or Western scholarly frames; they may hallucinate, interpolate, or over-regularize conceptual structures that in fact remain deeply culture-bound.
+A key concern—especially in a field like folklore—is the epistemological validity of any structure generated by a model trained on vast, culturally uneven corpora. LLMs may reflect dominant narrative tropes or Western scholarly assumptions, and can sometimes hallucinate, interpolate, or over-regularize conceptual structures that are in fact deeply culture-bound.
 
 For that reason, a core component of the GLOS project moving forward is the evaluation of LLM-assisted conceptual induction. This is not simply about whether the models “get it right,” but whether they support the identification of meaningful cultural differences, point to interesting structural convergences, or enable new questions. It is also about testing how different models behave: GPT-3.5 versus GPT-4, Claude versus Gemini, with and without agentive prompt scaffolding.
